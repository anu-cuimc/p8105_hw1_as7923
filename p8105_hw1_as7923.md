## PROBLEM 1

I loaded the required library, and a portion of the dataset is displayed
below.

``` r
library("moderndive")
data("early_january_weather")
head(early_january_weather)
```

The early_january_weather dataset contains hourly meteorological data
from Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) for January 1st to 15th
in 2013. While the R help documentation mentions that the dataset
includes data from three NYC airports (EWR, LGA, and JFK), a quick look
at the origin column using unique() reveals only EWR data is present.

The dataset includes 358 rows and 15 columns, with the key
variables/measurements including:

- temp - temperature in degrees Fahrenheit
- dewp - dewpoint in degrees Fahrenheit
- humid - relative humidity (percentage)
- wind_dir - wind direction in degrees
- wind_speed - wind speed in miles per hour
- wind_gust - wind gust speed in miles per hour
- precip - precipitation in inches
- pressure - sea level pressure in millibars
- visib - visibility in miles
- time_hour - date and hour of recording (POSIXct format)

The mean temperature during January 2013 was 39.58 degrees Fahrenheit.

Using ggplot() from the tidyverse library, a scatterplot of time
vs. temperature was created.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
scatterplot_temperature = ggplot(early_january_weather, 
       aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid )) + 
    geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Temperature vs. Time (with Humidity)",
       x = "Date and Hour",
       y = "Temperature (°F)",
       color = "Relative Humidity (%)" )
scatterplot_temperature
```

![](p8105_hw1_as7923_files/figure-gfm/scatterplot-1.png)<!-- -->

From observing the scatterplot, an upward trend is apparent, as days
progressed from early January to mid-January, the temperature generally
increased.An oscillating pattern is also visible from the plot, where
temperatures typically rise during daytime, and fall during night. There
is no distinct trend with humidity, but it appears that humidity
decreases at higher temperatures (noticeable at the small peaks in the
graph).

The plot created has been saved in the project directory as a PNG file.

``` r
ggsave("scatterplot_temperature.png", plot = scatterplot_temperature)
```

## PROBLEM 2

Using data.frame() a dataframe has been generated below, as per the
given requirements.

``` r
# setting seed to produce same random values each run
set.seed(7923)

problem2_df = data.frame(
  # random sample of 10 from standard Normal dist.
  numeric_var = rnorm(10), 
  
  # logical vector (TRUE if > 0)                             
  logical_var = rnorm(10) > 0, 
  
  # character vector of length 10
  character_var = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),  
  
  # factor vector of length 10,  with 3 levels
  factor_var = factor(rep(c("low", "medium", "high"), length.out = 10))  
)

problem2_df
```

    ##    numeric_var logical_var character_var factor_var
    ## 1   -0.5125996        TRUE             a        low
    ## 2   -0.4992100        TRUE             b     medium
    ## 3   -1.1698579        TRUE             c       high
    ## 4   -0.5537893        TRUE             d        low
    ## 5    1.0272743       FALSE             e     medium
    ## 6   -0.2735427       FALSE             f       high
    ## 7    0.3489992        TRUE             g        low
    ## 8    1.0030249       FALSE             h     medium
    ## 9    1.7929175        TRUE             i       high
    ## 10   0.2143842       FALSE             j        low

After generating the above dataframe, the mean for each variable will be
derived below.

``` r
mean(problem2_df %>% pull(numeric_var))
```

    ## [1] 0.1377601

``` r
mean(problem2_df %>% pull(logical_var))
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(problem2_df %>% pull(character_var))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(problem2_df %>% pull(character_var)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(problem2_df %>% pull(factor_var))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(problem2_df %>% pull(factor_var)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

After running the above lines of code, only means for the numeric and
logical variables were calculated. The mean calculations for the
character and factor variables resulted in an error.

I will now apply as.numeric() to logical, character, and factor
variables, and see what happens.

``` r
as.numeric(problem2_df %>% pull(logical_var))
as.numeric(problem2_df %>% pull(character_var))
as.numeric(problem2_df %>% pull(factor_var))
```

The following is observed:

- Logical variable - TRUE values are converted to 1 and FALSE are
  converted to 0
- Character variable - NAs and a warning is produced, this is because
  letters cannot be converted to numbers
- Factor variable - Converts the factors to their underlying numeric
  values (2 = low, 3 = medium, 1 = high). The assigned values represent
  the factor levels

The conversion of the above value explains the results for means we saw
earlier. The mean of the logical variable generates the proportion of
TRUE values (hence we saw 0.6). Whereas, the means of character and
factor variables result in an error because there is no way to convert
letters into meaningful numeric values, and averaging categorical
variables such as low, medium, high is meaningless and does not make
sense.
